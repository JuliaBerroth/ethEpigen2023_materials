# Final Project: First notes

Students in this project: Julia Berroth, Timo Suter

1. What is the topic?
   * reanalysis of GR binding in the hippocampus, both at resting state and upon stress (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24967-z)

2. What data will you be using?
   * using the data from here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE126706

3. What are the analyses you wish to reproduce, or the questions you wish to answer?
   * significant binding peaks of GR
   * differential binding of GR after acute stress vs. early morning baseline conditions

4. Questions
   * What does the axis descriptions on figure 2c-f mean?
   * We don't know how to correctly download the data, so that we can use it for analysis. Can you help?
